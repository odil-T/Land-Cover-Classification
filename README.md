# Land-Cover-Classification

This project currently is in progress.

The idea of the project is to perform panoptic segmentation on satellite images to perform land cover classification.

The land cover can be classified with a semantic segmentation model.

The instance segmentation of cars and buildings can be performed by an object detection model that feeds the detected bounding boxes to SAM for instance segmentation.
