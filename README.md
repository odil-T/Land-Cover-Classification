# Land-Cover-Classification

This project is currenty in progress.

The idea of the project is to perform panoptic segmentation on satellite images to perform land cover classification. The land cover can be classified with a semantic segmentation model. The instance segmentation of trees and buildings can be performed by a separate model. The resulting outputs can be overlayed for the final output.
